The Galaxy engine is a Cross Universe rules engine written in Javascript, mainly for https://battle.crossuniverse.net.  
Yes, it is named after Galaxy Train, how could you tell?



## Development Setup

Working on the engine is currently easiest by just cloning the repo for [Cross Universe Online Battle](https://github.com/Psychpsyo/Cross-Universe-Online-Frontend) and using its local version for testing.
