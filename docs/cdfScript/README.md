# CDF Script Documentation

For Galaxy Engine to be able to understand a card, it needs to be expressed as a `.cdf` file.  
Figuring out if CDF stands for "Card Description File" or "Card Definition File" is left as an excercise to the reader.

The structure of a `.cdf` file is explained in the section '[CDF File Structure](./cdfFileStructure.md)'.

Complex effects are written in a bespoke scripting language, called '[CDF Script](./cdfScriptOverview.md)'.

There are no `.cfd` Files for tokens as all the info to generate them is contained within the script of the card that creates them.
